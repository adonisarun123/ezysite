## 🔄 Additional Enhancement Tasks

### ✅ Bareilly Landing Page Service Links (COMPLETED)
**Issue Identified:** The Bareilly landing page (`app/cities/bareilly/page.tsx`) was missing the detailed service cards with links to individual service pages. This section existed in the Bangalore landing page but was absent in Bareilly.

**Changes Implemented:**
1. ✅ Replaced simple badge sections with comprehensive service card sections
2. ✅ Added clickable cards with service descriptions, features, and "Learn More" links
3. ✅ Matched the structure and styling of Bangalore's service sections

**Service Cards Added:**
- **Domestic Staff Services Section (9 cards):**
  - Live-In Maid → `/cities/bareilly/live-in-maid`
  - Full-Time Maid → `/cities/bareilly/full-time-maid`
  - Part-Time Maid → `/cities/bareilly/part-time-maid`
  - On-Demand Helper → `/cities/bareilly/on-demand-helper`
  - Babysitter → `/cities/bareilly/babysitter`
  - Japa Maid → `/cities/bareilly/japa`
  - Elderly Care → `/cities/bareilly/elderly-care`
  - Cook → `/cities/bareilly/cooks`
  - Driver → `/cities/bareilly/drivers`

- **Home Maintenance Services Section (5 cards):**
  - Carpenter → `/cities/bareilly/carpenter`
  - Electrician → `/cities/bareilly/electrician`
  - Appliance Repair → `/cities/bareilly/appliance-repair`
  - Plumber → `/cities/bareilly/plumber`
  - Painter → `/cities/bareilly/painting`

**Status:** ✅ Completed
**File Updated:** `app/cities/bareilly/page.tsx`
   
3. **Bareilly City Pages (15 pages)**
   - Update all service pages with Bareilly-specific metadata
   - Add missing canonical tags for Main Service and Live-In Maid pages
   - Create FAQ schema for Live-In Maid page
   - Complete FAQ data for Painter page

### Batch Processing Approach
Due to the large number of pages, implementing in batches:
- Batch 1: ✅ General pages 1-12 (COMPLETED)
- Batch 2: ⏳ General pages 13-16 (IN PROGRESS)
- Batch 3: ⏳ Bangalore pages 1-8
- Batch 4: ⏳ Bangalore pages 9-16
- Batch 5: ⏳ Bareilly pages 1-8
- Batch 6: ⏳ Bareilly pages 9-15

## Testing Required After Implementation
- [ ] Verify all canonical URLs are correct and accessible
- [ ] Test FAQ schema markup with Google Rich Results Test
- [ ] Validate meta descriptions are under 160 characters
- [ ] Validate meta titles are under 60 characters
- [ ] Check H1 tags are unique per page
- [ ] Verify all pages load correctly

## Notes
- All updates follow Next.js 13+ metadata conventions
- Canonical URLs use www subdomain as per plan
- FAQ schemas should be added as structured data (JSON-LD format)
- City-specific pages include localized content (salary ranges, area names, cultural context)
